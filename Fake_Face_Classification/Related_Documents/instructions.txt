There are two files of the same code in in this folder one is a python 
file and another is a ipython notebook. we can test the same code by 
running the ipython notebook on google cloab. The instructions for 
running and testing the code is given below.
 
1. Open the ipython notebook in google colab.
2. run the importing libraries code line.

Note: the training and the testing codes are included in the same notebook
following are the instructions for testing them both.

# for training the models:
1. mount the google drive where the data is uploaded by running first line of the code in "Model Training" Section.
2. add the path where you have stored the data in the drive for training and testing purpose.
Note: I have downloaded the data for training the model form the following link of "kaggle".
https://www.kaggle.com/ciplab/real-and-fake-face-detection
3. run the consicutive codes for training and saving the models which are also given in the file itself.

# for testing the model:
1. upload the model named "Fake_Face_Detector_improved.h5" and "haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml" to the currently running ipython notebook.
2. now start running code lines in the Section named "Model Testing" for testing the designed code for testing the whole models and the 
   classification code for the provided images into the categories stated in the guidelines.
3. run the last two lines for code if you want to generate the output.csv file.
